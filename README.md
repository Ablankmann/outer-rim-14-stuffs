Outer Rim 14 is a fork of [Space Station 14](https://spacestation14.io/), with a focus on space flight, asteroid mining, and exploration instead of Space Station 14's round-to-round destructive chaos.
Due to the capabilities of RobustToolbox, Space Station 14's game engine, Outer Rim 14 is a drop-in replacement for the standard game when hosting or playing, requiring no extra effort on the player's part.

Outer Rim 14 is still early in development; please wait if you wish to see more content, or, better, help code the game yourself.
Like the main game, all code added to Outer Rim 14 is under the same license as the main Space Station 14 repo.
All audio and image assets unique to Outer Rim 14 are ideally to be licensed under CC-BY-NC-SA 4.0, if possible.
