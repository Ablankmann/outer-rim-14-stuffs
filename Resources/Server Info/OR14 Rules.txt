[color=#ff0000]You must be 16 or older to play. Users under 13 will be banned immediately per the game's TOS, users above that but under 16 will be banned normally.[/color]

[color=#a4885c]1.[/color] This server is, ideally, HRP. Focus on building a character just as much as you focus on playing the game.
    - A little bit of lore:
    NT does not exist. You are in a debris field within the gravity well of PSR J0952â€“0607, a millisecond pulsar, as a collection of independent parties.
    FTL travel is non-functional within this region, and as such for all intents and purposes does not exist.
    You are thankfully, not nearly close enough to be within the danger zone of the pulsar, and as a result it only visible as a bright spot within the background.

[color=#a4885c]2.[/color] The respawn button allows you to go back to the lobby, however, you cannot rejoin as the same character if you use it, and must join as a different character. If you wish to keep paying one character, get cloned.
    - This does not apply between rounds, do not worry. This is not a permadeath server, this simply avoids having three copies of one character.
[color=#a4885c]3.[/color] Don't mindlessly screw over your fellows. Conflict, however, is accepted, but please don't make me write escalation rules.
